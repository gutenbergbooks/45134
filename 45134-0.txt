THE END OF GEORGIE'S AND JACKY'S HOLIDAYS.

(_A Second Extract from the Note-Book of Mr. Barlow the Younger._)

Now that the summer vacation is drawing rapidly to a close, it may
be as well to record the end of the holidays of my two interesting
charges, GEORGIE and JACKY. Some little time since
I wrote the story of one of their exploits. The two lads do not
live a very eventful life even in their hours of recreation. During
the mid-annual recess I usually choose some delightful spot for our
temporary home, combining the joint charms of change of scene and
increased economy. The fashionable watering-place of Drainville-on-Sea
has a suburb in which apartments may be obtained at a very reasonable
figure. The reason for this lowness of price is no doubt to be traced
to the fact that many of the residences are in the habitation of the
superfluous live stock of a very prosperous pork merchant, having
his house of business in the neighbourhood. However, in spite of our
distance from Drainville-on-Sea, my lads have been fairly contented
with their lot. They have been able to fish, to climb trees, and to
take long walks.

[Illustration]

"Revered Sir," said, on one occasion, GEORGIE, who is
generally accepted as the spendthrift of my brace of students, "it
would give great pleasure to JACKY if you were kindly to give
me a shilling with which to purchase Japanese caramel cannon-balls. I
have reasons for believing that his medical attendant, Dr. COFFYN
BLOCKHEAD, considers that this delicious sweetstuff, or, I should
say, pleasing physic, would be of much benefit to him."

"Why is the lad ill?" I asked, with an anxiety tempered with
incredulity.

"No, revered Sir," promptly replied GEORGIE; "and I fancy
that Dr. COFFYN BLOCKHEAD regards the composition, which may
be obtained at a penny the ounce, or two ounces for three halfpence,
rather as a preventative than a curative. Were JACKY to
have a shilling's-worth, he would not only possess enough to ward
off the shaft of the destroyer himself, but would be able to give
me a sufficient quantity to parry the insidious dart of disease;
and that you might be satisfied that the money was expended in the
life-protecting compound in question, _I_ would willingly undertake to
make the purchase."

Here JACKY protested that he was quite old and conscientious
enough to be trusted with the cash himself.

"Not that I have any doubt of my respected comrade's probity," he
quickly added; "but in matters of business one cannot be too careful."

"My dear pupils," said I, "nothing would give me greater pleasure than
to accede to your request, had I the means at hand. I fancy, in spite
of the opinion of Dr. COFFYN BLOCKHEAD--a physician whose name
I now hear for the first time--that I should have to consider the cost
of Japanese caramel cannon-balls as an incident properly chargeable to
pocket-money. Unfortunately you both exhausted that fund a fortnight
since, by causing me to defray the expenses of a donkey ride, which
mounted up in the aggregate to no less an amount than one shilling and
eightpence halfpenny."

"But surely, revered Sir," suggested GEORGIE, who has a bent
for mathematics; "as our parents allow us half-a-sovereign a week each
for the purposes of recreation, the sum you mention, although not
inconsiderable, would scarcely have----"

"Stop!" I cried, with some show of severity; "you really must not argue
with me. I do not give you all your ten shillings a week, as I am
reserving a portion of them to form the nucleus of an old-age pension
to which you will become entitled on reaching eighty. The scheme is not
without complications, so I reserve its description in detail until you
are both old enough to understand it. Enough to say that I must repeat
the present advance of a shilling is impossible."

After this rebuff the lads were silent, and I regret to say not
altogether contented. However, they soon, with the elasticity of
youth, regained their spirits, and were as merry and as happy as
ever. They absented themselves from my society more frequently than
before, and when I saw them, seemed to be unusually prosperous, or to
use an expressive colloquialism, "flush of money." GEORGIE
continually appeared in gigantic collars that could have only been
acquired at considerable expense, and JACKY as often carried
a new walking-stick with a fairly costly handle. On one occasion they
came home with a gift for me. It was a mug with a rough sketch of a
mule or some less noble animal on the side balancing the handle, and
was labelled "A Present from Drainville-on-Sea." I was gratified, but
my satisfaction savoured of curiosity.

During the absence of my pupils I frequently visited the neighbouring
watering-place. Amongst the many distractions of the sands was one
"entertainment" which caused me considerable embarrassment. Two
"mysterious minstrels" disguised in wideawakes, blue spectacles, and
comforters occasionally made what is known as a "dead set" at me. These
vocalists (who were small, but noisy), did a roaring trade amongst the
excursionists. They seemed to have a long _r√©pertoire_ of songs. They
vocally narrated the adventures of a young person from the country,
who seemingly, with a view to enjoying the restorative effects of
sea-bathing, appeared with "her hair hanging down her back," and the
vagaries of a body of revellers who preferred to parade the streets
"nine in a row," instead of in couples or singly, when they were in a
condition subsequently recognised by the presiding magistrate with a
fine of five shillings. These ditties were not altogether unamusing,
and I might have enjoyed them had they not been supplemented by a song
dealing personally with myself. This last effort was mere doggerel,
but it was so insulting that I was forced to give the vocalists into
custody. I explained that the lines were calculated to cause a breach
of the peace, and the local policeman removed the singers to the
station-house.

[Illustration]

This last adventure caused me some annoyance, and I returned to my
suburban lodgings in the hope that in the cheerful conversation
of my charges I might forget my chagrin. Neither GEORGIE
nor JACKY were at home. The hours of dinner, tea, and
supper passed, and they still put in no appearance. This caused me
considerable surprise, as, although not very regular in their habits,
they were accustomed to pay attention to the fixtures of meal time.
Late in the evening, a police constable called, and explained to me
that two boys had sent for me, as a householder, to bail them out.

The remainder of my narrative is clouded with pain. I would willingly
stop at this point. But, with a view to completeness, I continue. On
reaching the police-station, I learned to my indignation that the
"mysterious minstrels" and my charges had the same identity. This
discovery will ever be a cause of deep regret to myself, and, I think I
may add, for very practical and sufficient reasons, to GEORGIE
and JACKY also.

A DIALOGUE OF THE NIGHT.

SCENE--_The Shades at Nightfall. The Swiftian Ladies alone._

_Lady Smart._ Well, ladies; now let us have a cup of discourse to
ourselves.

_Lady Answerall._ Tea and tattle! That is all the men used to think us
fit for.

_Lady Sparkish._ But how times have changed--above stairs!

_Lady Smart._ Fie! Say rather _below_ stairs, Lady SPARKISH.
Up and down are arbitrary or relative terms after all, in the universe.
And I'm sure there are no fine drawing-room manners in the modern
modish world.

_Miss Notable._ Heigho! Methinks, nevertheless, I would fain take the
air of a London Season once again, however fallen off from the dear
dead days of Mr. SPECTATOR.

_Lady Answerall._ Hush, child! What would Charon say if he heard you?
Though in truth I am much of your mind myself.

_Lady Sparkish._ Better their vivid vulgarity than our vapid gentility!

_Miss Notable._ La, yes! Our vaporous "fine manners" give me the
vapours.

_Lady Smart._ They do not have "vapours" now, above--well t'other side
the Styx, let us say.

_Lady Answerall._ Indeed, no, nothing so simple and womanly, i' faith.
_They_ have substituted neurotic pessimism--and chloral.

_Lady Smart._ Worse far than our occasional sly sippings of--strong
waters!

_Lady Answerall._ What said the dear satiric Dean?

  "Now all alone poor madam sits
  In vapours and hysteric fits;
  A dreadful interval of spleen
  How shall we pass the time between?
  Here, BETTY, let me take my drops,
  And feel my pulse, I know it stops;
  This head of mine, lord, how it swims
  And such a pain in all my limbs!"

_Miss Notable._ Whereas now it would be:--

  "Now sad and sole poor madam lies,
  Insomnia holding wide her eyes:
  'Past ten, and not a single wink.
  Though I turned in at four, I think!
  If I don't get some hours of sleep,
  To-day's appointments can I keep?
  And 'tis the Prince's garden-party!
  Oh! to be buxom, hale, and hearty
  Like some mere milkmaid, who can drowse
  After a frolic and a bowse,
  Upon a tumbled truss of hay!
  I _must_ have sleep. BETTY, I say,
  Bring me the cognac and the choral!'
  --You may supply the modern moral!"

_Lady Sparkish._ La, child, you are as much a blue-stocking as the
modish she-scribblers of the century-end. _We_ used to leave all that
sort of thing to Grub Street.

_Miss Notable._ Tilly-vally! Grub Street has been made genteel since
the ladies took to haunting it. 'Tis now no shabby Alsatia, but a
swell sanctuary. Faith, one o' these odd-cum-shortlies--as we used to
say--I'll e'en write "The Journal of a Modern Lady" (in imitation of
the Dean) up-to-date, for 1895, instead of 1728, to wit.

_Lady Smart._ Have a care, child! Already you simper like a furmety
kettle, and slop over like an ill-made junket. Soon you'll be as smug
and self-conscious as a new member of "The Souls," if you be not
watchful.

_Miss Notable._ Well, but now the men are away, what really think you,
_entre nous_, of the New Woman movement?

_Lady Answerall._ Why, that 'tis older than MARY
WOOLSTONECROFT, and, in fact, originated about the time when
EVE took the first bite at the first apple.

_Miss Notable._ Heigho! 'Tis fine to sit here in the Shades, and say
so; but I own I should like well enough to ruffle it in new-fangled
clubs and select coteries, to be the talk of the town as APHRA
BEHN was, only in the irreproachable company of popular _savants_
and Bishops' sons; to see my niminy-piminy neuroticisms go into their
tenth edition, have my anti-matrimonial mouthings discussed in monthly
magazines and religious newspapers, and--have a free slap at the
monster, Man, whose best voluntary treatment of us means, at bottom,
nothing better than a golden cage and a silken gag.

_Lady Sparkish._ "Fine words! I wonder where you stole 'em!"--as the
Dean said concerning Chief Justice WHITSHED'S coach-motto.

_Miss Notable._ Humph! Did he not also say, in dealing with _The
Furniture of a Woman's Mind_--

  "For conversation well endued
  She calls it witty to be rude"?

_Lady Sparkish._ What _do_ you mean, Miss?

_Miss Notable._ Ha! ha! ha! Not much. But, as Lady ANSWERALL
used to say, when we had a dish of tea and tittle-tattle together in
the sweet, solid, wicked, bewitching old modish days, "You know I'm old
Tell-truth, and love to call a spade a spade."

_Lady Sparkish._ Oh, I see. As the dear old Dean also said--

  "Say, foolish females, bold and blind,
  Say, by what fatal turn of mind,
  Are you on vices most severe
  Wherein yourselves have greatest share?"

 [_Here arises a general criss-cross clatter of contradictions, and the
 gentlemen come in to join the ladies._

_Mr. Neverout_ (_quoting_)--

  "Now voices over voices rise,
  While each to be the loudest vies;
  They contradict, affirm, dispute,
  No single tongue one moment mute;
  All mad to speak and none to hearken,
  They set the very lap-dog barking."

We were disputing, ladies, as to whether these lines were
SWIFT'S or another's. Can _you_ settle the point?

_Miss Notable_ (_snappishly_). Oh, ask a policeman--or a New Woman!!!

OUR OWN TORRIST IN NORTH DEVON.

[Illustration]

_On Torrs Walks, Ilfracombe._--"Here they come by twos and twos, In
twos on Torrs they swarm." Quotation adapted. "Two" form a Company
Limited on Torrs Walks. The third person present is "out of it." They
tell me these couples are all honeymooners. Perhaps; but _if they are
not, they ought to be_. That's all.

* * *

Maybe these duologues are only private rehearsals. Practice makes
perfect. I have no special information on this mysterious subject.

* * *

_On the above-mentioned Honeymooners_--

  "Marriages are made in heav'n,"
  When begun in Northern Dev'n.

* * *

A descriptive writer says, "In the Torrs Walks are to be found the
most bracing spots in all Ilfracombe." From what I have accidentally
observed, I should correct the above sentence thus:--"_In the Torrs
Walks are to be found some of the most em-bracing spots in all
Ilfracombe_."

* * *

_Rara Avis in Torr-is._--Seldom are birds seen flying about, and
still fewer hopping about, the Torrs. My jocose friend WILLY
WAGSTAFF says "Birds only go 'hopping' in Kent." Good-bye to W.
W. Somehow, as a rule, the birds do not affect the Torrs. I fancy the
twopence for entry is a prohibition. Once I saw a lonely bird on the
_penny_ path; but _that_ was a pigeon.

* * *

I have seen a whole flock of rooks cawing querulously--"quirring" would
be a better descriptive participle--on and about the lower part of the
precipitous, rocky Torrs; but never have I seen them perching on the
highest point of the Torrs, which is as inaccessible to these birds
at twopence as would be the aforesaid lower portion to the unwinged
pedestrian even at a halfpenny; unless pedestrian should arrive at
rookery by accidentally tumbling over from above, in which case it is
much to be feared he would probably be "left till called for."

* * *

One of the most interesting sights on the Torrs is the occasional
appearance of a kindly gentleman, carrying a snow-white cockatoo, with
a magnificent yellow crest, perfectly tame, and perched on his owner's
wrist, just as the parrot used to perch on the wrist of our old friend
_Robinson Crusoe_.

* * *

The parrot, unchained, is a genuine "Bird of Freedom"; but he never
misuses his liberty, nor abuses his privilege of speech, but, from time
to time, he erects or lowers his crest, and expresses his approbation
of things in general, or his disapprobation of anything in particular.
A great companion this POLLY.

* * *

_Recent Solar Discovery._--I picked it up on Torrs Walks. The sun was
setting magnificently. Near me there stood, observing the effect, a
young lady and a very old one. Quoth the former, "It is a grand sun,
isn't it?" And the other replied, "It _is_ a grand-sun, indeed." Being
evidently a grandmamma, she ought to know.

* * *

Not knowing anything about the political bias of the majority at
Ilfracombe, I should say the voters must be chiefly Torr-ies.

* * *

Of the steamers plying between Ilfracombe, Swansea, Bristol, and other
neighbouring places, it cannot honestly be said that "they are no great
shakes." If the Master of the Rolls possesses any nautical authority,
it might be advantageously exercised in regard to some of these
steamers.

* * *

The rule for debarcation and embarcation (on the Swansea, Ilfracombe,
&c., steamers) appears to be, "Insure the least amount of convenience
to the greatest number possible." The inconvenience might be modified
(to put it gently) were the following suggestions acted upon:--

1st. From Ilfracombe pier there should be four sets of stairs (or more)
instead of two.

2nd. Make an upper and a lower deck to pier; the latter for shelter
during rain and storm. Your hardy sea-dogs seem to be perfectly unaware
of the existence of water descending from the clouds. With them the
rain is "_in nubibus_."

3rd. There should be two steamers to any one place, one departing
just a quarter of an hour before the other's arrival. Call them "Box"
and "Cox"--as they both occupy the same harbour. Thus the pier would
never be inconveniently, or dangerously, crowded by an outgoing and an
incoming crowd at the same moment.

4th. _Bigger steamers._

5th. Greatly improved catering, on board, _absolutely necessary_. More
hands to wait at table.

6th. Other improvements _essential_, but not necessary to mention here
in detail.

* * *

On board an excursion steamer I would retain the musicians, especially
the cornet; so many persons "come out for a blow" that the absence of
this member of the orchestra would be seriously felt.

* * *

_On board our steamer "The Brighton," to Tenby and back._--I think we
must have had "the Something-ean minstrels," whose performance was so
graphically described by DICKENS in _Pickwick_ as enlivening
Mrs. LEO HUNTER'S garden party, when "three of them grunted
and the fourth howled"; only that, on this occasion, there were about
eight or ten of these minstrel boys from Cardiff, who, having left
their Welsh harps behind them, sat in the centre of the upper deck,
inflicting their delightful melodies on such of the passengers as were
unable to get out of earshot without either going below, where it was
"stuffy," or into the fore part of the vessel. When these Cambrian
Choristers were not singing they indulged in a little rough and ready
play with each others caps, a humorous proceeding that seemed to afford
them almost as much pleasure as did the sound of their own voices, for
the applause with which they greeted every specimen of their skill in
vocalisation was touchingly unanimous. In this demonstration of mutual
approbation I did not notice any passengers taking part.

* * *

Now suppose a party of amateur and comic musicians, a party of
amateur choristers, and a Salvationist chorus all on board at the
same time, and suppose that all these different parties had commenced
simultaneously, each party giving its special form of entertainment,
would life be worth living on board that steamer? Surely the captain,
or the company, could put up a notice that only the paid professional
musicians would be allowed to play and sing on board, and so stop this
Excursionist Babel.

* * *

Advice to passengers by steamboat proposing to land at Lundy
Island--_Don't_. Lundy is a most interesting island, though it doesn't
look it. _Further Advice._--Stay on board and read all about Lundy
Island in your Murray's guide, and, probably, you will then have
acquired far more knowledge of the place than is ever obtained by the
majority who are permitted and even encouraged to crowd the rowing
boats plying between the steamer and the shore. I, _moi qui parle_,
saw the men bailing the water out of these boats as they returned from
shore; saw the men and women jammed up together trying to keep at least
their ankles dry; and if there had only been some playful 'Arries
among the lot, just a lurch to one side, or the other, would at least
have shipped enough water to have drenched them up to the knees, and
then one frightened person might in terror have capsized the boat. I
do not know who regulates these matters, I only describe what I saw
with my own eyes and what struck me as being decidedly perilous. Is it
impossible to build out a pier at Lundy Island? If impossible, cannot
some regulation as to the number every boat is to carry be enforced?[A]

[Footnote A: Since writing this Your Own Torrist is glad to find his
remarks anticipated by the _Western Daily Press_ (Bristol, September
6), which hints at improvements about to be made in the landing of
passengers both at Lynmouth and at the Mumbles. Let the condition of
things be bettered also at Lundy and at Ilfracombe.]

* * *

The perfumes of Ilfracombe (I think I saw the "Perfume d'Ilfracombe"
advertised as sold in bottles at a local hairdresser's) are various
at various times. Always on the Torrs is the perfume perfect. But
in the lower part of the town they are select and peculiar; as
thus:--Early morning, coming from bathing, and passing by hotels and
boarding-houses, appetising perfume of eggs and bacon everywhere, with
that of fried fish thrown in. The perfume in the road by the tennis
courts, where the donkey chairs and cabs stand, is, as may be imagined,
most delightful when all the flys and donkeys are there at midday,
afternoon, and evening. And in the early morning the faint reminiscence
of yesterday's donkey and cab-stand perfume is, it need hardly be said,
most exhilarating and delightful to the unbreakfasted passer-by.

"CURRANT" RECORDS.--The Cunard steamer _Aleppo_, with a cargo
of 1500 tons of currants on board, has succeeded in raisin' the record
between Patras and Liverpool, having accomplished the voyage in 9 days
21-1/2 hours. This vessel has the honour of being the first in with
the new currant crop, and, as a reward, she will be allowed "enhanced
freights." 1500 tons of currants fully entitle her, we should say, to
"take the cake."

                                        Scare or shock,
  Is particularly funny, and sech fares means--mostly--money.

  Oh, Rads may talk of Ransom, but give me a dashing Hansom,
    A silk topper, and a decent run of luck,--
                                        Cabby's luck;
  With a bay 'oss to my liking, and you won't ketch _me_ a striking,
    Not without good cause, as some old pals 'ave struck,--
                                        Lately struck.
  Things may go a trifle 'ard 'twixt bad weather and the yard,
    But _that_ won't knock out the Piccadilly Pup,--
                                        Dilly Pup.
  On my "SHREWSBURY and TALBOT," I'm as right as rain--or _all_ but,--
    And there's music in the 'ail of Hansom Up!--
                                        Hansom _Up!_

  "_Hansom Up!_" I can tell yer, was chorussed a good 'un, and took most tremenjous. Collection that night--
  For a broken-down Growler a-twist with rheumatics--was somethink to brim 'is wife's heyes with delight.
  Oh, charity's charity, _but_ when a Princess presides there's a extry strong pull at yer purse.
  And ditto with 'armony! That's 'uman nature; we're just built that way--an' _it might'a' bin worse!_

"AFTER THE PLAY IS OVER."

 SCENE--_Smoking-room of recently re-opened Old-Established
 Club. Members discovered partaking of light refreshments._

_First Member_ (_sipping a lemon squash_). Yes, the Royalty is
decidedly improved in appearance, and the audience, too, is quite up
to the standard of the old _Ixion plus Black-eyed Susan_ days. Quite a
pretty house, and quite a distinguished set in the auditorium.

_Second Mem._ (_lighting a cigarette_). And the play?

_First Mem._ Distinctly amusing. Both BOURCHIER and his wife
excellent, and KATE PHILLIPS, as a sorrow-stricken cook,
capital. Not quite sure whether it would not have been better to have
left _M. le Directeur_ in France. He was there to the manner born; but
in England--well, to put it plainly, the Home Office in Soho is not in
the least like the Home Office in Whitehall.

_Third Mem._ (_finishing a glass of "improved" soda water_). But is it
intended to be?

_Second Mem._ I don't know, but a good many of the audience (presumably
the gentlemen of the pit and gallery) will adopt the assumption. After
all, to be a member of the Civil Service is something, even in these
degenerate days. The sketch of official life in Soho will not enhance
the dignity of the--shall we call it?--profession. But concede that
the local colouring is appropriate, and _The Chili Widow_ is simply
first-rate.

_Third Mem._ Better than _Bogey_ at the St. James's?

_Second Mem._ So I have been told. And how about the Garrick?

_First Mem._ _Alabama_, with WILLARD. Not particularly
exciting. We know how good a man the popular actor can be, but
for stage purposes he is much more pleasing as a villain. And
TOOLE is back again in his own theatre?

_Second Mem._ So I have been told. If, as report has it, the visit is
to say farewell, it will be a sad one. Take it all round, there is no
better actor in the world than the hero of _Ici on parle Fran√ßais_, and
the embodiment of _Pau Claudian_.

_First Mem._ I quite agree with you. Has any one been to see _India_ at
Earl's Court?

_Third Mem._ I have. About as fine a spectacle as they make them. The
Empress Theatre, worthy of its name--the entertainment appropriate to
its surroundings. Quite eclipses Olympia in its most prosperous days.
And if you want to see how a few scraps of waste land can be converted
into a region of gardens, museums, theatres, and palaces, just mount
the Great Wheel, and look down upon the scene below you.

under RHODES if the white man is to be free to 'convey'

  We sympathise with your great woe,
                    Bechuana.
  There's little rest for Chiefs below,
                    Bechuana.
  In sultry climes, in climes of snow,
  The drink will come, the land will go,

  The liquor interest is crowing,

  Bung is blowing, drink is flowing,
  RHODES like one o'clock is going,

  Where they will stop there is no knowing,

                    Bechuana,

  KHAMA, it is a grievous sight.
  And you, you seem to have done right,
                    Bechuana,
  Since you your troth to us did plight,
                    Bechuana!

  Sober, industrious, fond of peace,
                    Bechuana,
  You've kept your tribe. May it increase,
                    Bechuana.
  If, you would have the traffic cease,
  Why should your heart not have that ease,
                    Bechuana?
  Sobriety is the best police,
                    Bechuana!

  It _is_ a vile, corroding curse,
                    Bechuana.
  We do not wish, quite the reverse,
                    Bechuana,
  That, just to fill a huckster-purse,
  Your tribe should go from bad to worse,
                    Bechuana.
  Twere a foul shame! That's true and terse,
                    Bechuana!

  Let Gain go hang, let Bung be blowed,

  Rather than drunkenness corrode,

  The realm whereby Molopo flowed.
  To KHAMA Britons much have owed,
                    Bechuana;

SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.

Commercial prosperity continues to attend the cheery coster as he hawks
his wares about the Liverpudlian streets, and the situation is getting
hawkward for the local tradesman, who declares that the itinerant
vendor's opposition draws away customers from his shop. So momentous,
indeed, to the welfare of the Lancastrian port has this Cockney
Crusade become, that the magnates of the City Corporation assembled in
Committee to discuss means for "making the coster go back to London."
Among other weighty reasons for the expulsion of the intruder, it was
stated that "a gentleman trod upon a banana peel the other day, and
fell." Whether the peel was deposited by an offending coster, or by one
of the many bare-footed but picturesque and ingenuous youths of the
town, history does not relate. However, the great gravity of the crisis
may be understood when, towards the end of the debate on the question,
we are told that the chairman observed that, "if this thing was allowed
to go on, perhaps a certain alderman and himself would start a barrow
with a picture on it, and go about selling fine arts." Chorus of
aldermen:--

  Round the town! Up and down!
  Anything to earn an honest brown:
    Civic costers enterprising,
    Up-to-date and early-rising,

BRAEMAR Castle is to be restored. "The alterations on the

Creag Choinnich"--a good coigne of vantage this, by the way--"the
traveller will have no difficulty in recognising the castle." Good.
Beau BRUMMELL once snubbed a sovereign, but we should hate to
run the risk of cutting a castle. The same authority further informs
us that the edifice in question "stands on a grassy mound between the
Deeside road and the river Dee, and _as it is not surrounded by trees_
it forms a rather conspicuous object in the landscape." Dee-side-dly
this smacks more of Erin than of Caledonia, and calls to mind PAT

THE AGE OF LOVE.

(_To the Editor of "Punch."_)

 SIR,--Is it possible, in the so-called end of this so-called
 nineteenth century, to dream of such a thing as the Age of Love? The
 man of to-day, if he be wise, thinks not of the face and form of the
 woman he may care to marry, but asks himself the question, "Will she
 make me a good wife? Can she clean chimneys, cook and mend; is she
 capable of discussing intellectually subjects of interest--such as
 dentistry, hunting, symbolism, and so forth--with her husband? Can she
 grind the organ, play the comb, is she active at crossing-sweeping
 and cradle-rocking, quick at smiling away one's smiles and frowning
 away one's tears, ready to greet all my friends with the same
 amiability she shows to _me_, is she prepared for intelligent
 begging-letter-writing, can she scour, skirt-dance, recite, carve,
 mangle, and fence?" Too often he is bound to answer, "No, she cannot;
 so what good is she to me?" I do not mean to say that all women are
 like this. Heaven forbid! But good housewives are few and far between.
 There are many girls of the period who are deficient in one or even
 more of the accomplishments above-mentioned, so how can she be fitted
 for the wife of a middle-class man?

 It is all very well to love, but a vastly different matter to marry
 such women as these. Good sound reason and common-sense are better
 articles to possess. We cannot have too much of that--indeed, we
 often get a great deal more than is good for us, so that in my humble
 opinion friendship, common-sense, logic, and grammar are worth more
 than all the love any man or woman can give; and it is all very well
 to sneer at pessimists, but in my humble opinion they have only
 themselves to blame for it, and through all ages it will ever be the
 same until there is some alteration.

  I am, Sir, your obedient servant,       A SENSIBLE PESSIMIST.

  _Alma Villa, Sebastopol Road, Balham._

 SIR,--There is an old saying with which we are all
 acquainted, and which affirms that "there are as pretty kettles of
 fish in the sea as ever came out of it." If you will permit me, I will
 quote my own case.

 At the age of seventy-two I married the man of my choice. We had
 been married for seven days, when, alas! the truth forced itself
 relentlessly upon me that my husband was suffering from depression
 of spirits. His nature, which had always been a gay and joyous one,
 became apathetic; he seemed indifferent to my society, and before many
 weeks were over he bored himself to death.

 I think before eighty is only April sort of sunshine, which only
 brings flowers, &c., into bud; it is June, July, and October sunshine
 that makes, or the want of it that mars, the harvest. There are many
 of my own and the other sex still unmarried, pure, gentle, and loving
 old women, who, I think, would gladly enter matrimony. Alas! Love is
 laughed about and joked about, but the souls it has ruined are few.
 Trusting you will find space for my poor scribble, I am, Sir,

  Your obedient servant,      HAPPY BROWN BESS.

THE CONQUEROR.

 [Mr. H. N. PILLSBURY, a young American master of twenty-two
 years, won the first prize in the Chess Tournament at Hastings.]

  Two Battles of Hastings--when young scholars rattle
    Their "dates" off--henceforth may be reckoned:
  If WILLIAM the Norman did win the first battle,
    'Twas PILLSBURY pulled off the second.
  A very young player old STEINITZ to tackle,
    Or enter the lists against LASKER!
  When History's Muse is henceforth on the cackle,
    One question a scholar may ask her,--
  "Oh, which was the greater, chess-champion or war-man?"
    In chess there is no hanky-panky;
  Less _fair_ was the win of the tricky old Norman,
    Than that of the quiet young Yankee!

The "alliterative" epidemic, in connection with the names of marine
resorts, is spreading to an alarming extent. A Welsh newspaper heads
a quotation from the _Western Daily Press_ by the taking title of
"Improving Ilfracombe." This, however, has nought to do with the
excellent mental and physical benefits derived by visitors to the North
Devonian pleasure port, but refers to District Council resolutions
for the improvement of the place itself--a Quixotic idea, which seems
identical with that of "painting a lily." To the scribe of the "Seaside
Series," whose penchant is for "apt alliteration's artful aid," we
beg to offer--without any extra charge--a few suggestions to go on
with:--Soothing Southend, Winsome Whitby, Congressional Cardiff,
Sweltering Swansea, Peaceful Penzance, or "piratical" ditto, and so on

BALL _VERSUS_ BALL.

AN AUTUMN ECLOGUE.

 _The rivals, Cricket Ball and Football, like Menalcas and Damoetas,
 defend their favourite Sports, and make their friend Punch (like
 Palemon) judge of their performances._

  _Football._ Ho! Hurry up and put yourself away!
  September's here, and Cricket's had its day.
  You and your Bat have had a wondrous boom,
  Now for a manlier sport, and Me, make room!

  _Cricket Ball._ A _manlier_ sport? Tell that to sordid Tykes!
  The "brass," and not the game, is what he likes
  Who kicks your swollen and unshapely form
  Through snow and mud, in fog and frozen storm;
  And in pursuit of silver pots and pelf,
  Makes a dishevelled mudlark of himself;
  Then calls it--Sport! O, there! don't talk to me.
  _I_'m not a slave to sludge and L. S. D.

  _Football._ Pooh! If I'm kicked you're spanked. The foot of GUNN
  Hurts less than does his bat. Pray is it fun
  To bide O'BRIEN'S buffet? Have you scored
  After two hours--at Hastings--with big FORD?
  GRACE thumps you for nine Centuries in one season,
  And after _that_ you crow with little reason!

  _Cricket Ball._ Oh, GRACE and GUNN lay on to me _in love_,
  FORD'S "gentle tap," O'BRIEN'S "friendly shove"
  Hurt not my feelings more than a slight slap
  From rosy fingers hurts an amorous chap.
  But you stand kicks _for halfpence_. Question it?
  Well, just you read about the Football Split
  And the two rival Unions!

  _Football._               That's all fudge.
  The North is of true Sport the truest judge!
  How about GRACE'S Testimonial?

  _Cricket Ball._                _Not_
  A sample of the Hunting of the Pot,
  But a free tribute to a sportsman prime,
  Who plays the game right through, and laughs at Time.
  But rowdyism and mere greed of gain
  Will spoil the noblest sport. I speak with pain.

  _Football._ You spheric Pharisee! Don't sniff and brag,
  Go join the Bat in his green winter bag!
  A hum-drum hibernation is your doom,
  The winter season's mine, for me make room!

  _Cricket Ball._ Alas! 'tis true! Retirement is my lot.
  The bright green sward, blue skies, and sunshine hot,
  September sees an end of. I rejoice
  The Surrey Cricket Club has given its voice
  Against the money-mania that would make
  The Oval turf a frozen swampy lake,
  Pounded by heavy-footed Football cracks,
  Galloping "forwards," elephantine "backs."
  It makes me shudder on my shelf to think
  Of that green sward, smooth-surfaced as a rink
  Where sturdy ABEL cut and drove amain,
  And RICHARDSON sent "rippers" down like rain;
  Where the white-flannel'd fielders sometimes flopped,
  While saucy Surrey sparrows pecked and hopped,--
  To think of it all trampled, pounded, ploughed,
  By fierce footballers, whilst a furious crowd
  Howled in a hideous ring.

  _Football._               Oh, shut up, do!
  The S. C. C.'s are an old-fashioned crew,
  Who soon will find they are not up to date,
  And they'll be sorry--when perhaps too late.
  Football's a manly sport for Titan lads!

  _Cricket Ball._ But spoiled by huckster cliques and noisy cads.

  _Football._ Cricket is slow, quite stodgy now and then.

  _Cricket Ball._ But 'tis a sport for friends and gentlemen.

  _Palemon Punch._

  In either sport such honest pleasure lies
  That both must win, as each deserves, a prize.
  The summer sport is each true Briton's care,
  But Football's death would leave our winters bare
  Of numerous joys. Damoetas sweetly sang
  And clear the music of Menalcas rang;
  "Rest equal happy both," in friendly strains
  Palemon said to the Virgilian swains;
  "Long live and prosper both," _Punch_ says to you;
  But O beware the howling harpy crew
  Who'd knock the "I" out of our good old Play
  And make it all a matter of mere Pay!
  The rowdies follow where the hucksters lead,
  Football beware of ruffianly greed!
  You're treading far too near that fatal trap;
  Avoid it, or you'll suffer. _Verbum sap!_
  You, cricket ball, to bounce be not a slave.
  Let "championships" and "averages" have
  Their proper place. Let love of Number One
  Spoil not good sport, good fellowship, good fun.
  In short, whether good luck or bad luck comes
  Just "play the game," like gentlemen and chums!
  So having given his verdict somewhat loth,
  _Punch_ ends with wishing the best luck to both!

GOOSE AND GANDER.--A sapient Somebody (or Nobody) modestly
proposes that, in taking a poll for a Free Library, everybody who does
not take the trouble to register his vote at all shall be counted as if
he had voted _against_ the proposal! Well, what is sauce for the goose
is sauce for the gander. Suppose that all who don't take the trouble to
vote should be counted as voting _for_ the proposal. There's at least
as much to be said for that as for the opposite plan.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.

[Illustration]

Ostend must be a glorious place. From an advertisement which has
appeared in an evening contemporary I gather that "the multitude,
anxious to spend an elegant and fashionable sojourn in the country,
has rendered itself this year at Ostend. It is a long time since such
an opulent client√®le has been united in a seaside resort. At the fall
of day the vast terraces of the fashionable restaurants, situated
along the sea-bank, present a fairy aspect. There is quite a confusion
of dazzling costumes upon which sparkle thousand gems, and all this
handsome cosmopolitan society passes through the saloons of the Kursaal
Club, in which one hears spoken all known languages as at Babel and
Monte Carlo, and of which the attractions are identical to those of
the latter place." This is the first time I have heard of a similarity
to Babel being mentioned as an attraction. But no doubt an opulent
client√®le has peculiar tastes of its own, especially when its dazzling
costumes sparkle with thousand gems.

In a small Belgian town (naturally not Ostend) I once saw the following
notice hung over the door of a washerwoman's establishment:--

  Anglish linge tooke here from 1 sou
  Shert, cols, soaks, sleep-shert, pokets.
              I eet my hatt.

The last sentence puzzled me for a long time. Finally I came to the
conclusion that it was not intended so much to be a statement of actual
fact as an enticement to English people, who would of course take all
their washing to a lady commanding so gay and accurate a knowledge of
an English catch-phrase.

       *       *       *       *       *

My third example of English as she is spoke is from a notice issued by
an out-of-the-way hotel in Italy, which had changed its management:--

 The nobles and noblesses traveller are beg to tell that the direction
 of this splendid hotel have bettered himself. And the strangers will
 also find high comforting luxuries, hot cold water coffee bath and
 all things of perfect establishment and at prices fixed. Table d'h√¥te
 best of Italy France everywere. Onclean linens is quick wash and
 every journals is buy for readers. Beds hard or soaft at the taste of
 traveller. Soaps everywere plenty. Very cheaper than other hotel. No
 mosquits no parrot no rat.

       *       *       *       *       *

And this (though the connection is not, at first sight, very clear)
brings me to the Vicar of Sparkbrook. Only the other day he was
presiding at a meeting held in aid of the funds of the Christ Church
(Sparkbrook) Day Schools. Alluding to the importance of maintaining
Church Schools, he said (I quote from a Birmingham paper) that "though
he did not want to touch on politics, he must express his thankfulness
that they had a Government in power which was favourable to Church
Schools, and which was pledged to construct, and not to destruct."
The Vicar's feeling for emphasis is admirable. The sentence gains
immeasurably in force by the perversion "destruct." And we ought to be
specially grateful to him for refraining from the other alternative. If
he had said, as it was open for him to say, "which was pledged not to
destroy, but to constroy," the effect would have been terrible.

I was staying at a London hotel a short time ago and had occasion to
write a letter in the public reading-room. Sitting down to one of
the writing-tables and opening the portfolio I found that a previous
occupant had left in it an unfinished letter which, with all necessary
apologies, I here transcribe in full:

 MY DARLING HARRY,--I am fading like a flower deprived of
 its natural nourishment without you, my darling, my own little
 sniperpop----

[Illustration]

Now what, in the name of Dr. SAMUEL JOHNSON, can a "sniperpop"
be?

       *       *       *       *       *

  How shall I name you? Darling, dove,
    Partridge (or any other bird)
  Are not the names I seek, my love;
    I want just one caressing word,
  One word which, whether old or new,
    Shall prove my depth of love for you.

  Without it all my power is gone,
    Without my own I feebly fade:
  In vain I turn the lexicon,
    The word I want is not yet made.
  Must I entreat, to ease my pain,
    Divine Philology in vain?

  Ah, little nowadays it boots
    To imitate primeval man;
  Our Aryan ancestors had roots
    With which to formulate their plan.
  They used them all--they had their fun--
    And left us not a single one.

  Yet, oh my HARRY, something tells
    Your own she may, she must succeed--
  What's this? Yes, yes, ring out the bells;
    From grief's dark thunder-cloud I'm freed.
  No longer shall I droop or drop--
    _Eureka_, "little Sniperpop."

       *       *       *       *       *

In the _Newcastle Daily Journal_ I read that "for some time a
certain amount of feeling has existed at Crawcrook on the question
of horse-shoeing." This culminated in a challenge by JOSEPH
DELAFIELD to GEORGE LATHAN, both these gentlemen being
master blacksmiths. A match for ¬£5 was soon made, "each man to shoe the
foot of a draught-horse in the quickest and best style." Here there
must be some mistake, since if each man did the job in the quickest
and best style, the result obviously must be a dead heat. However "the
match commenced on Saturday morning at the shop of LATHAN.
After LATHAN finished his work, which occupied forty-three
minutes, the horse was driven to the shop of DELAFIELD, who
occupied forty-one minutes in the operation. Large crowds were on the
spot to witness the match. Mr. JOHN CHAPMAN of Whittonstall,
the judge, gave his decision in favour of LATHAN."

       *       *       *       *       *

There is something very sporting and attractive about all this. One man
wins the match, the other can console himself by the reflection that he
had two minutes the better of it on time. There seems to have been no
grumbling, and (although the fact is not stated) I have no doubt the
parties met at an enthusiastic dinner in the evening and toasted the
good old English sport of horse-shoeing. The authorities at Oxford and
Cambridge might do worse than institute a horse-shoeing competition
between teams of undergraduates, who would of course strike blue nails
into blue shoes with blue hammers. A "blazer" would be particularly
appropriate to such a contest.

OUR FASHION LETTER.

(_Extracted from the "Poppleton Academy College Gazette."_)

DEAR THOMAS,--As September advances, the wave of fashion is
once more filling our best academies, so that a few hints as to the
latest _modes_ may well be of service to you. Have you seen the new
double pocket? It is quite _chic_. It is constructed simply enough
by making a large hole in the side-pockets of your coat, thereby
you will find there is an useful space beneath the lining, in which
such necessary trifles as a lump of toffee or a Jew's-harp can be
comfortably disposed of. Buttons will not be much worn, especially as
the term advances. It is rumoured that FORKER _major_ has
gone into tails; and if this be true, probably others will follow his
example before long.

My old friend RICHARD--a well-known connoisseur in such
matters--strongly recommends the new confectioner's shop near the
school. The Turkish Delight sold there is quite admirable, I am told,
and a single bar of the stick-jaw, if used carefully, will last for
an entire day. Talking of shopping, I have been to the bookseller's
lately. What a misfortune it is that the publishers do not issue
Messrs. BOHN'S Classical Library at a lower price! The present
one is almost prohibitive to those of us who wish to avoid a certain
amount of drudgery, and to please our excellent pedagogues at the same
time.

Have you heard rumours of a boom in marbles? Hitherto one has
associated the game with the lower classes, but I understand that two
Upper-Fifth gentlemen were seen to play it last week. If so, it will
soon be widely popular. By the way, the report that JOHNSON
_minor_ is seriously ill is absurd. The truth of the matter is, that
this dashing sportsman had undertaken to eat thirty cracknels in ten
minutes, without drink of any kind. The result--he lost by half a
cracknel--was to cause him some temporary inconvenience, but he is now
completely restored to health.

Here are two recipes, which, I think, you will like:--

1. _Bacon √† la Dormitory._ Procure a piece of bacon, and cut it into
strips. Impale these, one at a time, on a penholder, and frizzle them
slowly over the dormitory gas. (Care should be taken that the tutor
is out, as the fragrance caused by the bacon is considerable.) When
sufficiently done, chop up with penknives, and serve hot. Condensed
milk should be drunk with this dish.

2. _Marrons √† la Poppleton._ Place some chestnuts between the bars of
the fireplace. Do not break the skins. Presently the roasted nuts will
fly into the room with a loud report, and much amusement will be caused
if they happen to hit anybody on the face. They may then be picked up
and eaten. Sherbet is an appropriate drink with which to accompany them.

  Yours ever,
  WILLIAM.
